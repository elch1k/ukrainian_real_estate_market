# Analytical and machine learning-based price forecasting of the flat real estate market
**Preface:** This project is an upgraded version of my previous work, which related to the [analysis and ML prediction of rental prices for flats in Kharkiv city](https://github.com/elch1k/kharkiv_real_estate_rent_market). This initiative focuses on researching both rental and sales flat prices across all of Ukraine's main administrative regions. It involves [detailed analysis](https://github.com/elch1k/ukrainian_real_estate_market/blob/main/eda_and_ml/lun_real_estate_eda.ipynb) and [machine learning modeling for sales flat prices](https://github.com/elch1k/ukrainian_real_estate_market/blob/main/eda_and_ml/lun_real_estate_ml.ipynb), along with developing a data collection pipeline from the trusted source: [**Rieltor.ua**](https://rieltor.ua/).

You're welcome to use the project's parser (located in <span style="background:#e6edf3; border-radius:6px; padding:2px 6px; font-family:monospace;">main.py</span>) for your own research and ML modeling. The collected data can be stored in a flat file format or your relational database.

Analytical part
--
This section focuses on data preprocessing and outlier handling for both sales and rental transactions. Following this, a detailed structural analysis of the flat real estate market is presented for both sales and rental deal types. For the full report, please visit the notebook with this [link](https://github.com/elch1k/ukrainian_real_estate_market/blob/main/eda_and_ml/lun_real_estate_eda.ipynb).
