# Analytical and machine learning-based price forecasting of the flat real estate market
**Preface:** This project is an upgraded version of my previous work, which related to the [analysis and ML prediction of rental prices for flats in Kharkiv city](https://github.com/elch1k/kharkiv_real_estate_rent_market). This initiative focuses on researching flat prices across Ukraine's main regions, conducting detailed analysis and machine learning modeling, and developing a data collection pipeline from the trusted source: (Rieltor.ua)[https://rieltor.ua/].
